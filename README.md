# odin-recipes
My first official website!
This site consists of 3 recipes that represent 
my culture and food tastes. It consists of the
ingredients, steps, images and links to the 
seperate recipe pages. 
I've learned how to set up a boilerplate for 
each webpage, create ordered and unordered lists, 
display images from a seperate webpage, and create links 
to the listed recipes.
